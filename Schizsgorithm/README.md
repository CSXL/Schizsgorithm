The Schizsgorithm is a complex machine learning algorithm capable of schizophrenia detection via electrode data from EEG. The current accuracy is 66%
for this model. The project is open source and can be used by variety of people including enthusiastic geeks all the way till medical institution. It was created
by Srinidhi Srujan Murthy, founder of CSX laboratories. This is our first open source project and research project.Schizsgorithm will be published on our website and will
be under an MIT license.



The Schizsgorithm model is a life changing biotech tool that can instantly detect neural brain activity and identify whether a person is schiziophernic.
The model should be connected to EEGs for recieving its input sources.It does not require hardware components to function due to everything just being a model.
The model has been trained with loads of EEG data and has an accuracy metric score above 50%.Schizsgorithm employees a pipeline for cunducting various data
processes and acquires a scaler for restructuring data.For cross-validation purposes we use GroupKfold which is similar to the K fold cross validation.A logistic
regression is the main model that is being used for prediction making.Lastly a Grid search CV is used for prediction and training the model.


My primary motivation as to writing a model to detect Schiziophernia is so make sure people/patients are correctly identified with reference to their brain activity.
This can help doctors detect whether patients need Schiziophernic treatment or not.Worldwide there are 24 million schiziophernic patients and there has not been any 
tool that can detect if a person has it.In order to fill in the unsaturated biotech market I decided to develop schizsgorithm.



Specifically this Product can be used by people in a variety of fields.Computer Science researchers can study the model and can be used in their teaching curriculum to explain 
to students how machine learning can be used in real world application.Computer science researchers can use it to explain how ML models reverse engineer the connections between 
data and labels and how predictions can be made.Doctors or neuralogists are the main customers/users of the product since they will be using it on their mental patients to see 
whether schiziophernic treatment in needed or not.




The credits go towards Danial Yeager.Danial Yeager is a neural computer science researcher at UC Berkeley who has written an approach on wireless neural interface for 
prosthetics.That has helped me start my expedition in this topic.I was able to understand about neuron anatomy and how EEGs work.Additionally credits go towards coding
non profits such as freecodecamp.org and codewithmosh as their videos help me understand how ML works and how to write machine learning works.Lastly the credits go to Talha Anwar a 
Computer Science enthusiast for helping me get datasets.






The Schizsgorithm is of great use when it comes to helping people and inspiring new research in the industry.It will have great impact once published and used by people.
The model was built with compassion and passion to make sure the best result is delivered.
